Engineers often discuss the distinction between what we refer to as _Soft Skills_ and _Hard Skills_.

Both are skills, but their use is entirely different.

A company hires us for our _hard skills_, but in most cases, our level of _soft skills_ makes it possible. Our _soft skills_ make a difference in our perception of our work.

I haven't found a good definition of what a soft skill is and what it includes in this category; there is an interesting discussion about this topic. For this reason, I prefer not to discuss _soft skills_ in this book, but rather **booster ðŸš€ skills**.

There are excellent books on increasing productivity. The concept of growing productivity makes me think of ways to produce more, not to produce better.

As engineers, we shouldn't focus on producing more units but on delivering better, more robust, and maintainable outputs.

For this reason, I prefer to discuss enhancement rather than productivity. We can't add more time to our days, at least not without compromising our quality of life, but we can improve the way we do the things we do.

This framework is the culmination of over twenty years of engineering work.

I've been trying, testing, exploring, and failing to find what works and what doesn't, all from my perspective.

I organized this framework into blocks, each of which dives into a specific concept. Although I originally conceived it to be read sequentially, you can skip those topics that are not of interest at any moment, except for the first chapter. The first part lays the groundwork for why this approach is practical and why you should consider each technique.

In each section, you will find exercises to practice the skills presented, as well as specific bibliographic references to explore the concepts and gather more information about each technique.
