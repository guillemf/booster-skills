Thank you for the time you are investing in visiting this site. I know how precious time is, and I appreciate your trust and interest in reading what I compiled to help all professionals to improve and reduce friction. I want this framework to be a continuous work of improvement, so I will incorporate any suggestions that I find helpful.

None of the concepts included in this framework are entirely new ideas. Still, it is a compilation of different techniques, procedures, and behaviors that worked for me to achieve a big goal: putting the cherry on the top of the cake at the end. This concept, the cherry, means that no task is complete if you can't finish it or can't transfer it. By transfer, I mean enabling others to understand what you did fully and allowing them to use or share your ideas with others.

This is a personal version of all the techniques I will share, and I invite you to improve, adapt, and share each one. One of my principles is to use only those things that work for me. If something doesn't work for you, but you realize that adding a couple of changes would make it work for you, adapt it to your needs with no regret. If something doesn't work or has no advantage, drop it.

At the very least, I would appreciate if you take the opportunity to learn the techniques outlined here. If they don't work for you, please let me know by writing to me and explaining why. Could you help me improve it?
