Thank you for the time you are investing in reading this book. I know how precious time is, and I appreciate your trust and interest in reading what I compiled to help all professionals to improve and reduce friction. I want this book to be a continuous work of improvement, so I will incorporate any suggestions that I find helpful.

None of the concepts included in this book are entirely new ideas. Still, it is a compilation of different techniques, procedures, and behaviors that worked for me to achieve a big goal: putting the cherry on the top of the cake at the end. This concept, the cherry, means that no task is complete if you can't finish it or can't transfer it. By transfer, I mean enabling others to understand what you did fully and allowing them to use or share your ideas with others.

This book is a personal version of all the techniques I will share, and I invite you to improve, adapt, and share each one. One of my principles is to use only those things that work for me. If something doesn't work for you, but you realize that adding a couple of changes would make it work for you, adapt it to your needs with no regret. If something doesn't work or has no advantage, drop it.

At the very least, I would appreciate if you take the opportunity to learn the techniques outlined in the book. If they don't work for you, please let me know by writing to me and explaining why. Could you help me improve it?

Engineers often discuss the distinction between what we refer to as _Soft Skills_ and _Hard Skills_.

Both are skills, but their use is entirely different.

A company hires us for our _hard skills_,  but in most cases, our level of _soft skills_ makes it possible. Our _soft skills_ make a difference in our perception of our work.

I haven't found a good definition of what a soft skill is and what it includes in this category; there is an interesting discussion about this topic. For this reason, I prefer not to discuss _soft skills_ in this book, but rather **booster skills**.

There are excellent books on increasing productivity. The concept of growing productivity makes me think of procedures to produce more, not to produce better.

As engineers, we shouldn't focus on producing more units but on delivering better, more robust, and maintainable outputs.

For this reason, I prefer to discuss enhancement rather than productivity. We can't add more time to our days, at least not without compromising our quality of life, but we can improve the way we do the things we do.

This book is the culmination of over twenty years of egineering work.

I've been trying, testing, exploring, and failing to find what works and what doesn't, all from my perspective.

I organized this book into blocks, each of which dives into a specific concept. Although I originally conceived it to be read sequentially, you can skip those topics that are not of interest at any moment, except for the first chapter. The first chapter lays the groundwork for why this approach is practical and why you should consider each techniqdeveloperue.

In each chapter, you will find exercises to practice the skills presented, as well as specific bibliographic references to explore the concepts and gather more information about each technique.

C> ### Part 1: CPU

### Chapter 1: Task Manager

We all spend most of our time sitting in front of a computer writing things such as computer programs, reports, or emails, and this sometimes makes us believe we are as powerful or as strict as a machine, but we are not. We possess excellent skills, but we need to identify which skills we have and how to utilize them effectively. This chapter lays the groundwork you need to understand grasping the rest of the techniques described in this book.

### Chapter 2: RAM

It is one of the most important resources you have, your memory. Your memory can be very helpful or a nightmare. When not used correctly, your memory is like a heavy weight on your shoulders, trying to maintain more information than you should. You can learn what to add to your memory and how to incorporate it so that it will last and be accessible when needed. If you utilize your memory effectively, it can be an invaluable asset to enhance your daily work.

### Chapter 3: Process Organization

Now that you know your memory is not infinite and how to utilize it effectively, you must organize your work accordingly. The first tool you need in your toolbox is to organize and manage your daily tasks efficiently. You can't do what you need to do if you don't know what to do. This chapter will discuss various techniques for organizing and planning your days.
