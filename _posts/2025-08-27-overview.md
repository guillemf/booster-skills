We all spend most of our time sitting in front of a computer writing things such as computer programs, reports, or emails, and this sometimes makes us believe we are as powerful or as strict as a machine, but we are not. We possess excellent skills, but we need to identify which skills we have and how to utilize them effectively. This chapter lays the groundwork you need to understand grasping the rest of the techniques described in this book.
